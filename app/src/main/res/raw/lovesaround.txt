Ever been in love
Ever really love someone
People tend to rush
People tend to run to love
Only takes one
To show you what it means to love
Love

I'm missing you tonight
I'm wishing you were right here
'Cause when love's around
'Cause when love's around

Never feels right
Never feel that type of way
But I need you in my life
Yeah, you could be my wife for real
Only takes a woman
To show you what it means to love
 

To love

I'm missing you tonight
I'm wishing you were right here
'Cause when love's around
'Cause when love's around
'Cause when love's around
'Cause when love's around

Keep me up until the morning
You can see it in my aura
You been givin' it your all and I'm fallin' for you
Keep me up until the morning
You can see it in my aura
You been givin' it your all and I'm fallin' for you

'Cause when love's around
'Cause when love's around
'Cause when love's around
'Cause when love's around
'Cause when love's around
