Only you know me the way you know me
Only you forgive me when I'm sorry
Need you when I'm broken, when I'm fixed
Need you when I'm well, when I'm sick
Friends that I rely on don't come through
They run like the river, but not you
Can't see when I'm fallin', losing myself
But then I hear you calling
There you are, there you are
You're there with open arms
There you are, there you are
And I run
Whispers in the background, behind closed doors
I got myself in a mess and without you I'm in more
Oh, I'm a little drunk now, that's why I went to war
Oh, yeah, you are my sober when I'm on the floor
Can't see when I'm fallin', losing myself
But then I hear you calling
There you are, there you are
You're there with open arms
There you are, there you are
And I run
Only you know me the way you know me
Only you forgive me when I'm sorry
Even when I messed it up
There you are
Need you when I'm hot
And when I'm cold
Need you when I'm young
When I'm old
You won't be far
There you are, there you are
You're there with open arms
There you are, there you are
And I run
Only you know me the way you know me
Only you forgive me when I'm sorry
Even when I messed it up
There you are
When you're caught in the crowds
When you're up in the clouds
When you're caught in the crowds
When you're up in the clouds
There you are
