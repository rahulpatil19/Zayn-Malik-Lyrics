Nostalgia
What a funny feeling
I feel depleted
From feelings I've been revealing
It's do-or-die, I'm not going willing
But when it's time, wrap in white linen
I rap this
I say it for my sanity
Whatever the calamity I did this for myself
Fuck all of your fantasies
You're a snake, fell off the ladder
I prefer speaking in analogies
I've had enough of all this wet
And I can't trust that you're my family
I don't know what's next
The brain-dead that I never miss
My brain lives with the cannabis
Can I resist the dark abyss?
Leave a mark on this with no start, just exist
My mind's in a prism shape
And in times like prison state
There's no right that I feel of late

There's no light if my view's at stake
And which left should I choose to take
What's left, is it room or space?
There are rumors we have to face
I prefer sooner than after late
I seen actors after BAFTAs be more straight
I mean down the barrel
I hear them sing, it's the same carol
They're trying to sprint in a long run Mo Farah

They're trying to fix when it's long gone, don't bother
There's no other, the thought shudders
Through most lovers
I wanna bed you, but still sleep is Death's cousin
So two weeks is now four dozen
Years that pass by, can't press no rewind
Just watch my life by and lock the right ties

Nobody, nobody is listening to me
Nobody, nobody is listening
Nobody, nobody is listening to me
Nobody, nobody is listening to me
