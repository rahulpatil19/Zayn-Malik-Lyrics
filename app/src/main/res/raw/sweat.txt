Staying up for you
Day and night for you
We've been losing track of time
Reaching higher heights
Only one thing on my mind
Only one thing on my mind

Let me touch you where you like it
Let me do it for ya
Give you all of my attention
Dive into that ocean of your love, oh
Let me show you just how much I want ya

Oh, dripping down of my [?]
Slowly steaming up the windows
My skin on your skin again and again
Sweat for me, sweat for me
Oh, love you and I tear off your clothes
Slowly steaming up the windows
My skin on your skin again and again
Sweat for me, sweat for me

Damn, I could get lost in a heartbeat
Damn, I can't get over your body
Can't take my eyes of you, baby
 

Let me love you, baby

Let me touch you where you like it
Let me do it for ya
Give you all of my attention
Dive into that ocean of your love, oh
Let me show you just how much I want ya

Oh, dripping down of my [?]
Slowly steaming up the windows
My skin on your skin again and again
Sweat for me, sweat for me

Oh, I could get lost in a heartbeat
I can get lost in your body
Can't take my eyes of you, baby
Let me love you, baby

Oh, dripping down of my [?]
Slowly steaming up the windows
My skin on your skin again and again
Sweat for me, sweat for me
Oh, love you and I tear off your clothes
Slowly steaming up the windows
My skin on your skin again and again
Sweat for me, sweat for me
