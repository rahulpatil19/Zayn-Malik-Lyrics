Why's it gotta feel like I'm walking a tightrope
Why you wanna see how far I fall
'Cause I'm already up here and I got my eyes closed
And I ain't ever fell from a love this tall

Are you ready, 'cause I'm ready to let go
Never thought that I'd be ready again
Guess it's somethin' 'bout the neon red glow
Got me thinking about giving on in

Something told me it was you
Something told me it was you
Something told me it was you
Something told me it was you

Sitting with my legs across your torso
We are who we are when we're alone
Baby, I'm ready any minute, we might fall
Lately I feel like my grip is gone
But you got my arm

Are you ready, 'cause I'm ready to let go
Never thought that I'd be ready again
Guess it's somethin' 'bout the neon red glow
Got me thinking about giving on in

Something told me it was you
Something told me it was you
Something told me it was you
Something told me it was you

Chaudhvin Ka Chand ho
Ya Aaftaab Ho
Jo Bhi Ho Tum Khuda Ki
Kasam Lajawab Ho

Something told me it was you
Something told me it was you
Something told me it was you
Something told me it was you

Something told me it was you
Something told me it was you
Something told me it was you
Something told me it was you

Chaudhvin Ka Chand ho
Ya Aaftaab Ho
Jo Bhi Ho Tum Khuda Ki
Kasam Lajawab Ho
