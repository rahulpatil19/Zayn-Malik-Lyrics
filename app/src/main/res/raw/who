When you're started in the dark
And you struggle to find the light
When you just try to find your way
But you just can't find the time
I'll come for you
You know that I'll save you

Who you gonna call, gonna call?
Who you gonna call, gonna call?
When you need somebody
When you need someone
Who you gonna call, gonna call?
Who you gonna call, gonna call?
When you need somebody
When you need someone
When you need somebody
When you need someone
When you need somebody
When you need someone

When the water's just too deep
Getting chased by the shark
When the pressure's just too much
And you feel it in your heart
I'll come for you
You know that I'll save you

Who you gonna call, gonna call?
Who you gonna call, gonna call?
When you need somebody
When you need someone
Who you gonna call, gonna call?
Who you gonna call, gonna call?
When you need somebody
When you need someone

(Need somebody)
When you need somebody
(Need somebody)
When you need someone
When you need somebody
When you need someone

And who's right?
Let me know
I'll be there
I'll be close
It's your fear
That we won't
If this dies
Be my ghost

Who you gonna call, gonna call?
Who you gonna call, gonna call?
When you need somebody
When you need someone
Who you gonna call, gonna call?
Who you gonna call, gonna call?
When you need somebody
When you need someone

Who you gonna call, gonna call?
(Oh!)
Who you gonna call, gonna call?
(Oh!)
When you need somebody
When you need someone
Who you gonna call, gonna call?
Who you gonna call, gonna call?
(Oh!)

When you need somebody
When you need someone
When you need somebody
When you need someone
