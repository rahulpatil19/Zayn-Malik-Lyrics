This love is tainted
I need you and I hate it
You're caught between a dream
And a movie scene
In a way, you know what I mean

When the dark turns to mist,
I just can't resist it

'Cause I'm a fool for you and the things you do
I'm a fool for you and the things, the things you do
The things you do, the things you do

When you're looking like this
I just can't resist it
I know sometimes I hide it
But I can't this time 'cause it's gonna defeat me
But you won't believe me, believe me

'Cause I'm a fool for you and the things you do
I'm a fool for you and the things, the things you do

I know, I know given a chance I'd do it again
'Cause I can't help myself
'Cause I can't stop myself
I just love being a fool for you

'Cause I'm a fool for you and the things you do
I'm a fool for you and the things, the things you do

This love is tainted
