I'd rather be anywhere, anywhere but here
I'd rather be anywhere, anywhere but here
I close my eyes, I see a crowd of a thousand tears
I pray to God I didn't waste all my good yeaaars
All my good yeaaars
All my good yeaaars

The voice is screaming loud as hell
We don't care about no one else
Nothing in the world could bring us down
Now we're so high among the stars without a worry
And neither of one of us wants to say “I'm sorry”

I'd rather be anywhere, anywhere but here
I'd rather be anywhere, anywhere but here
I close my eyes, I see a crowd of a thousand tears
I pray to God I didn't waste all my good yeaaars
All my good yeaaars
All my good years

Too much d** and alcohol
What the hell were we fighting for?
Cause now the whole damn world will know
That we're too numb and just too dumb to change the story


Neither of one of us wants to say we're sorry

I'd rather be anywhere, anywhere but here
I'd rather be anywhere, anywhere but here
I close my eyes, I see a crowd of a thousand tears
I pray to God I didn't waste all my good yeaaars
All my good yeaaars
All my good years

Need a chance just to breathe, feel alive
And when the day meets the night, show me the light
Feel the wind and the fire, hold the pain deep inside
It's in my eyes, in my eyes

I'd rather be anywhere, anywhere but here
I'd rather be anywhere, anywhere but here
I close my eyes, I see a crowd of a thousand tears
I pray to God I didn't waste all my good yeaaars

All my good yeaaars
All my good yeaaars

I pray to God I didn't waste all my good yeaaars
All my good yeaaars
All my good years
