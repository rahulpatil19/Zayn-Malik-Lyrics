[ZAYN:]
Oh when I, on the same place
Show me in the same light
Feels right, when we take flight
Clothes off 'cause she's so soft
This ain't a fair fight, yeah
I wanna shed light
On this subject
I'll get her wetter than ever
Four letters is never the question
She likes when I'm messy
And I like when she's undressing

You're looking in the wrong place for my love
Don't think because you're with me this is real
You're looking in the wrong place for my love
Don't stop what you're doing 'cause I like that too

[Kehlani:]
Here with you 'cause you got the right vibe
Seems like you probably got a dope mind
But it's gotta be the right time
We're only good for the night time
I see through your demeanor
Baby, I'm a pleaser
I go out my way to treat you
But I can't be a teacher
'Cause I'm a problem with problems
I know who I am and I'm not no good
You can have me tonight or never
I thought you understood
Baby, some people are meant to be loved and others just make it
So take what I'm willing to give and love it or hate it

[ZAYN & Kehlani:]
You're looking in the wrong place for my love
Don't think because you're with me this is real
You're looking in the wrong place for my love
Don't stop what you're doing 'cause I like that too

[ZAYN:]
I don't, I don't really know
I don't, I don't really care
Maybe keep it on the low
With stories I don't wanna share

[Kehlani:]
Don't stop

[ZAYN & Kehlani 2x:]
You're looking in the wrong place for my love
Don't think because you're with me this is real
You're looking in the wrong place for my love
Don't stop what you're doing 'cause I like that too
