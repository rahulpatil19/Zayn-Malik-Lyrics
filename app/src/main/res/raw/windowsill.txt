[ZAYN:]
Fuckin' on the countertop, window to the floor
She been on my mind, that for she to be on the rope

She with me when I flow, she with me when I don't
Fuckin' on the countertop, [?]
She can ride me blind, I give anything she want
I never let her know, so she come back for more
Are you there yet? 'Cause I'm right here
Are you waitin' for the right time to call me back?

Cigarettes and fuckin, fuckin' on the windowsill
In my bed, yeah, tell me when you're gettin' here
Only thing I wanna kno-o-ow, oh
Is there far where you are?
Cigarettes and fuckin' on the windowsill
Break the glass, go and show me how you really feel
Come and give me some love
That's the way you show me love

I see the way she lookin' like she lookin' in my soul
Like, stop it, maybe this could lead to something that I won't

She with me when I flow, she with me when I don't
Fuckin' on the countertop, [?]
She can ride me blind, I give anything she want
I never let her know, so she come back for more
Are you there yet? 'Cause I'm right here
Are you waitin' for the right time to call me back?


Cigarettes and fuckin, fuckin' on the windowsill
In my bed, yeah, tell me when you're gettin' here
Only thing I wanna kno-o-ow, oh
Is there far where you are?
Cigarettes and fuckin' on the windowsill
Break the glass, go and show me how you really feel
Come and give me some love
That's the way you show me love

[Devlin:]
Your cigarettes on the windowsill
You left here from the night before
I take one, never light it up
Night comes and I want you more
So I can play dumb
When the rain comes, it will more than pour
But don't want no fake love, just a real freak
And I'm waitin', impatient
All I can do is man my station
When the body is that hot, it's a curse and [?]
And I ain't no salvation
This girl could walk though hell
And I'm sure she tempt Satan, if she ain't the devil herself

[ZAYN:]
Cigarettes and fuckin, fuckin' on the windowsill
In my bed, yeah, tell me when you're gettin' here
Only thing I wanna kno-o-ow, oh
Is there far where you are?
Cigarettes and fuckin' on the windowsill
Break the glass, go and show me how you really feel
Come and give me some love
That's the way you show me love
