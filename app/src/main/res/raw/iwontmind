Don't look around 'cause love is blind
And darling right now, I can't see you
I'm feeling proud so without a doubt
I can feel you

'Cause we are who we are
When no one's watching
And right from the start
You know I got you

Yeah, you know I got you...
(Yeah, you know I got you) [echo 5x]

I won't mind,
Even though I know you
You'll never be mine

I won't mind
Even though I know
You'll never be mine

(Never be mine)
(Never be mine)

We messed around until we found
The one thing we said we could never ever
Live without, I'm not allowed to talk about it
But I gotta tell you

'Cause we are who we are
When no one's watching
And right from the start
You know I got you

Yeah, you know I got you...
(Yeah, you know I got you) [echo 5x]

I won't mind
Even though I know you
You'll never be mine

I won't mind
Even though I know
You'll never be mine

(Never be mine)
(Never be mine)
