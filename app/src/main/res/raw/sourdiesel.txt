Walks in the place, hands on her waist
Gun on her thigh, big shooter game
She did this before, murdered to gain
Promised her ma she won't k** again.
(Zayn – Sour diesel)

She got it and she know she got it
I'm takin' off like a rocket
Spaceship, so high I can't stop it.

Like sour dieseeel
I can't stop the feelin', yeah
Can't stop your feet, no
Feels like I dream her
Didn't feel it seep in
She burn, she burn, she burn.

Like sour diesel (she burn, she burn, she burn)
Like sour dieseeel (she burn, she burn, she burn)
I can't stop the feelin' (she burn, she burn, she burn)
Can't stop your feet, no
Like a-sour dieseeel (she burn, she burn, she burn)
She burn, she burn, she burn
Like sour dieseeel.

The look's on her face, back in my place
Legs in the air, all dirty again
Smokin' some more, I'm in her space
She touches me there, then I do it again.

She got it and she know she got it
I'm takin' off like a rocket

Spaceship, so high I can't stop it.

Like a-sour diesel (she burn, she burn, she burn)
Like a-sour dieseeel (she burn, she burn, she burn)
I can't stop the feelin', no (she burn, she burn, she burn)
Can't stop your feet, no
Like a-sour dieseeel (she burn, she burn, she burn)
She burn, she burn, she burn
Like sour dieseeel (she burn, she burn, she burn)
Feels like the heat, yeah
When the flame is here (she burn, she burn, she burn)
Can't stop the heat, yeah
Can't stop the feet (she burn, she burn, she burn)
Like a-sour dieseeel
Can't stop the feelin', oh (she burn, she burn, she burn)
No I can't stop.

‘Cause it's burnin' all around you
I'm so glad I found you
‘Cause it's burnin' all around you
I'm so glad I found you
Woo, yeah, yeah.

Yeah! Like sour diesel (she burn, she burn, she burn)
Like sour dieseeel (she burn, she burn, she burn)
Like sour dieseeel (she burn, she burn, she burn)
Like a-sour dieseeel, like a-sour dieseeel (she burn, she burn, she burn)
Ooh, yeah (she burn, she burn, she burn)
I can't stop the feelin' (she burn, she burn, she burn)
Yeah, sour dieseeel, wow (she burn, she burn, she burn)
Like sour dieseeel (she burn, she burn, she burn)
She burnnn.
