Skies are blue and birds are yellow
Flowers growing just to bloom
A million chances of our glances
Catching eyes across the room


If time stands still
Move I will to you
This was filmed
Somehow I see you
Move I will to you

Break a ball upon your fence now
Yet your beauty would still shine
I would live a thousand life times
If it's you I'm sent to find

If time stands still
Move I will to you


This was filmed
Somehow I see you
Move I will to you

Move I don't want it babe

Left to rot, so tired of getting stuck
Nothing can stop us
Move I don't want it babe
Left to rot, so tired of getting stuck

If time stands still
Move I will to you
This was filmed
Somehow I see you
If time stands still (If time stands still)
Move I will to you (Move I will to you)
This was filmed
Somehow I see you (Some how I see you)
Move I will to you
