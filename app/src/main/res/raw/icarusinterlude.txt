Ooh-ooh (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Ooh-ooh (Ooh)
Ooh

Call me Icarus

I guess I flew too close to the sun
Myth'll call me legend, that might be why
In my Yves Saint Laurent
Get the bees coming in for the honey I supply
And if you ain't got it now, then you're in for a surprise
You won't get it in a lifetime (Lifetime)
I'm in the right place at the right time (Right time)

Girl, you love me better than anyone
Girl, you love me better than I've known
Girl, you love me better than I've known before
Better than I've known before
 

(Better than I've known before)
Ain't no stopping what I know (Before)
What I know, ain't no


Ain't no stopping what I feel
Plays on my mind in slo-mo
Every time as if it were real
Every night, oh, it's you I feel
That's how you're in my mind

I've been lying to the liars
I've been lying
I've been lying to the liars
I've been lying to the liars
I've been lying with the liars every night
Lying 'cause I'm flying
I've been lying to the liars
Lying to the liars
