[Chorus]
Don't keep me waiting
I've been waiting all night to get closer
And you already know I got it for ya
You know the vibes, know the vibes, put it on ya
If it movin' too fast, we go slower
Baby, lose it from me, mediocre
You know the vibes, know the vibes



[Verse]
You and me here in this room
Imagining things we could do
Won't tell no lies, no lies to you
I need you here, I need you here
Mind run 'round, we touchin' slow
Just say the word, I'm ready to go
Anticipation plays after four
I need you now

[Pre-Chorus]
Baby, I'ma get you right now, baby
When I touch you tell me how it feels
Trust me, I'ma make it feel surreal
Baby, mine, you're mine
I'ma do all the things
Type of things that happen in your dreams
Girl, you're right where you need to be
Just don't keep me


[Chorus]
Don't keep me waiting
I've been waiting all night to get closer
And you already know I got it for you
You know the vibes, know the vibes, put it on ya
If it movin' too fast, we go slower
Baby, lose it from me, mediocre
You got the vibes, got the vibes

[Bridge]
It for me, do it fast, do it fast



[Pre-Chorus]
Baby, I'ma get you right now, baby
When I touch you tell me how it feels
Trust me, I'ma make it feel surreal
Baby, mine, you're mine
I'ma do all the things
Type of things that happen in your dreams
Girl, you're right where you need to be
Just don't keep me

[Chorus]
Don't keep me waiting
I've been waiting all night to get closer
Yeah, you already know I got it for you
You know the vibes, know the vibes, put it on ya
If it movin' too fast, we go slower
Baby, lose it from me, mediocre
You got the vibes, got the vibes
