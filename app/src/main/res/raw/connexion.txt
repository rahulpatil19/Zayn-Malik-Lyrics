Funny when you come to mind
That's when you hit me up
That's when we feel a little closer
Just when I started thinking

It's like a force we can't explain
Work like a magnet, babe
Thought of you and the next moment
Giving me that feeling

Could be my suspicion
Maybe I'm just out here overthinking
Oh

Like you come into the picture
When I start to feel like something's missing
Oh

I don't wanna miss out on another love
So I'm gonna dive right in
Go head first into the unknown
Like it's all I know

Baby, could you keep it up?
Don't wanna stop at words, ain't enough
Feels just like a drug
Really fuck me up

Call it
A digital
But physical
Connection

Call it
A digital
But physical
Connection
